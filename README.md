# cryptography

I created this repository because I needed a way to encrypt my passwords while making those secrets accessible by my scripts. I also deal a lot with sensitive data from other people. It's my responsability to turn the data structure and accessible without exposing sensitive information.

In my research, I found a lot of good tools, but to supply my demand I had to do build some code by myself. So that I can use of those resources in a more suitable way.

##### In this repository I used some stand methods such as:

- AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) 
- PBFK2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function)
- Cipher (famous algorithm for performing encryption or decryption)
- SHA-2 (cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency)
- Fernet (famous algorithm for symmetric encryption and authentication to data)

##### Some importante Python libs that  I user were:

- getpass 	 
- Crypto 	 	 
- cryptography
- pandas
- base64
